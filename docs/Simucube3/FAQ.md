## Before you buy

??? question "Which rigs are compatible with Simucube 3?"

    Rig compatibility depends just on mechanical fitting and mounting, which means that most rigs are compatible at least with some installation effort. The wheelbase features threaded front mounting holes with a ⌀135mm (⌀5.32") pattern, and threaded adjustable bottom mounting holes with the width of 78.4mm (3.09").
	
	To get an idea, see [Drawings & 3D models](Drawings.md) for details of the supported mounting patterns and [Mounting](Mounting.md) for installation instructions.

    However, not all rigs are created equal. One quality aspect of simulator rigs are their rigidity and their vibration damping properties. Typically worst ones in this sense are thin and/or flexible metal structure rigs, while in other hand rigid metallic or plywood rigs exhibit high vibration damping. This may affect the quality of feeling, and in worst case could cause oscillation issues.

??? question "Does Simucube 3 require also the Simucube Link Hub?"

    Yes. Simucube 3 uses Simucube Link to ensure fast & stable communications between the device and Tuner. **One** Simucube Link Hub is required for any system using **one or more** Simucube Link devices. For systems with more than one Simucube Link device,
	an ethernet switch is also required. For list of required items, see [Items needed](Items needed.md).

??? question "Do I need additional items to use my ActivePedal with Simucube 3?"

    An ethernet switch is required to simultaneously connect multiple devices such as an ActivePedal and Simucube 3 to Simucube Link Hub. If you already own an ethernet switch and Link Hub, no additional items are required. For list of required items, see [Items needed](Items needed.md).
	
??? question "Which steering wheels work with Simucube 3?"

	Simucube 3 does not require any particular wheel technology to be utilized for the wheelbase to work. 
	
	
	Simucube Wireless Wheels work, since the connect to the Simucube Link Hub. They may also be equipped with a wheelside Link Quick Release to enable use with Simucube 3.
	
	USB-based wheels may also be equipped with Link Quick Release to enable use with Simucube 3. These wheels should be connected directly to the PC via an USB-cable for data transfer.
	
	The Link Quick Release can be directly attached to all wheels with a threaded or non-threaded 70mm quick release mounting pattern. Wheels with a threaded or non-threaded 50.8mm mounting pattern require an additional [adapter](../Accessories/50.8Adapter.md).
	
	

## After you have it

??? question "Should I power off Simucube 3 when not using it?"

    Simucube 3 should be powered off when not in use to ensure safe conditions around the device. This is especially important if untrained person, childer or pets have access to it. 
	
	Simucube 3 can be quickly powered on/off by using the white power switch on the Link Control Box.

??? question "Force feedback is disabled on my wheelbase. What should I do?"

	- Check that the Link Control Box is connected and that the power switch of the Control Box is in the "On" position.
	- Check if the Torque Off button of the Link Control Box is pressed. Release it by twisting it clockwise.
	- Try adjusting your torque settings via Tuner. If necessary, enable "high torque mode".
