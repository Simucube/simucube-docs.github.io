## Wheelbase installation

The illustration below demostrates how to connect a Simucube 3 wheelbase to a PC by using Simucube Link Hub *(sold separately)*.

!!! Info "Note"
    Simucube 3 Wheelbase can not be connected directly to a PC. Simucube Link Hub is required for inputs to register.

!!! Warning
    To avoid damaging devices and prevent physical hazards, make changes to cabling only when DC power source has been **fully unplugged** from the mains input (house wall AC power socket). Powering off with POWER button alone is not sufficient.
	
## Wheelbase + Active pedals

To connect multiple Simucube devices to a single Simucube Link Hub, such as Active Pedals, an ethernet switch is required. One such configuration with two Active Pedal Pros is demonstrated in the illustration below.
