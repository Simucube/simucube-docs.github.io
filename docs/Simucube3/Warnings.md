## General guidelines

**Please read the instructions below carefully. Misuse of the device may lead to serious injury.**

- Simucube 3 wheelbases are intended for professional use only. Usage under other conditions is
under user’s own responsibility.

- Do not grab, hold or insert fingers, etc. objects to the rotating parts in a way where letting
go immediately is not possible.

- Do not operate the Quick Release when the device is powered ON and connected to a PC.

	- Always disable torque by pressing Torque off button before removing or attaching
	wheel.

	- Do not release Torque off button unless the Quick Release has securely locked the steering wheel in place.

- Do not set torque level higher than the level user can safely hold with a single hand grip.

- If torque gets too high to control safely, let both hands off the wheel and press the Torque
off button.
