## Wheel side installation

Link Quick Release can be directly mounted on nearly any existing simulator steering wheel with a **70mm hole pattern** of either threaded or non-threaded holes. This allows the wheel to be quickly attached and detached from Simucube 3.

For wheels with a **50.8mm hole pattern,** a spacer-adapter is required. This part also functions with
threaded and non-threaded wheels. See more information at [50.8mm adapter](../Accessories/50.8Adapter.md).

The wireless data & power transfer features of Link Quick Release are supported on some Simucube Link compatible wheels. Whether or not these electronic features are supported by your steering wheel, Link Quick Release can still nevertheless be used for purely mechanical attachment purposes.

Follow the steps below to attach your Link Quick Release to a steering wheel.

### Connecting wheel electronics (compatible wheels only)

For compatible wheels, before mounting the quick release, locate the quick release connector inside the wheel.
Connect the cable of the Link Quick Release to the connector located on the circuit board of the wheel . 
**Do not pull on the cable with force while doing this.**

For wheels with no electronic support for Link Quick Release features, the cable may be tucked inside the rectangular shaped cavity of the Quick Release.

After connecting the cable, follow the intallation instructions below based on the type of attachment holes your steering wheel uses.


### Wheels with through holes

## Wheelbase side installation


All Simucube 3 wheelbases ship with the Simucube Link Quick Release wheelbase side part pre-installed.
This part can be detached by mechanically inclined users by following the steps below.

### Removing Simucube quick release

![](assets/QRDisassemblyStep1.svg){width=650}

!!! Info
    - Remove the two (2) torx T10 screws holding the circuit board.
	- Remove the circuit board. A small flat head screwdriver may be used to pry around the screw holes of the board.
	- Disconnect the wire connecting the Link QR circuit board to the wheelbase by pulling the connector.
	- **Do not try to detach the cable from the wheelbase shaft. This will cause damage your wheelbase.**
	
!!! Warning
	The T10 Torx screws can be damaged during removal if they are not opened with utmost care. Ensure that the key stays straight and maintain firm downwards pressure while turning the key.

!!! Info
    - Remove the three (3) hex screws using a 3mm hex key, and detach the quick release cone.
	- Make sure the cable does not get caught on the edge of the center hole.

!!! Info
    - Fold the cable inside the slot in the axle of the wheelbase.
	- To install a third party quick release, see [70mm Adapter](../Accessories/70Adapter.md).
	
### Re-installing Simucube quick release

!!! Info
    - Follow the steps above in reversed order.
	- For the three screws securing the part, use a torque of ~ 5Nm. For the two screws securing the circuit board, use a torque of ~ 1.2Nm.
	- Using thread locking fluid is recommended for the screws securing the circuit board.
	
### Installation on Simucube 2 wheelbases 

Simucube 2 wheelbases do not support mounting Link Quick Release directly to the wheelbase. Instead, [SC2 adapter plate](../Accessories/SC2Adapter.md) is required to attach the quick release system. 
**Note that the adapter only allows for the mechanical functions of Link Quick Release. Wireless power and data transfer is not supported on Simucube 2 wheelbases.**
