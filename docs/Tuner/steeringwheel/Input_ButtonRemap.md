### Configure Button Labels

Button labels are useful for users who have multiple steering wheels. Button labels can be changed, added or deleted and will affect also other steering wheels â€” reducing the repative action of labeling all steering wheels from the scratch.

:bulb: <font color="orange">Colors and their meaning:</font>

- <font color="orange">Orange = has already been used</font>
- <font color="orange">Gray = Has not been used in anything</font>

You may encouter an issue which is highlighted in the **Input** tab as yellow color on a button. This is an indication that the label isn't configured.

- To fix this, please make sure that you have assigned a label in **Configure Button Labels** window through the "hamburger" menu in top left corner.
- Or remap the button to some other label.
