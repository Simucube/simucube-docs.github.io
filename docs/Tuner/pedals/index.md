# Pedals

In Tuner you may control two (2) types of pedals: Active and Passive.

- Active Pedals give you real control to adjust the feeling to your liking via force curve adjustment, damping, endstop, effects and **Simulator Input Mapping**.

- Passive Pedals give you limited amount of options, mainly focusing on how the game receives the telemetry data with **Simulator Input Mapping**.
