![Wheelbase Profile](assets/tuner3_overview_no_sim_profile_example.png)

Tuner Software contains profiles for Wheelbase and Pedal devices. 

Profiles are quick and handy way to adjust parameters of your device to desired needs. Tuner contains built in default profiles, templates and even driver profiles, and creating your own profiles is also easy to do.

- Simucube 2 wheelbase profiles can be downloaded from **Paddock** (community-based profile sharing).
- Pedal profiles can be uploaded and downloaded from our discord server [Simucube Active Pedal Profiles](https://discord.gg/simucube).

!!! note "Note"
    You can [**Create shortcut for profiles**](../commandlineoptions.md).

Profiles have all the configurations of the device e.g. roles, force curves, effects and much more.

!!! warning "Warning" 
    Tuner software will automatically preserve changes made to the active profile, and reopening the software will restore all devices to the same settings that were used previously. This doesn't modify the saved version of the profile, which is only done when Save-button is pressed or when switching to different profile and saving the changes to the previous profile when prompted.
    
    Unsaved changes are indicated by the orange dot over the **profile button** which can be found in top right corner of the Configuration view or bottom button in device box in Overview.
