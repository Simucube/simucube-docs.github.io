!!! info "Connecting through Simucube 2 Wheelbase"
    To use this feature you will need to connect the wireless wheel via Simucube Link Hub,
    a separate device, instead through the Simucube 2. You can find the Simucube Link Hub 
    from our store page [here](https://simucube.com/link-hub/){ target="_blank" }.


## Input

### Open Input tab
1. Select Steering Wheel from the device list in overview or in left side panel
2. In top left corner under the ”hamburger" menu is a tab called "**Input**". Usually when you open the steering wheel this tab is automatically selected.

### Configure Button Labels

Button labels are useful for users who have multiple steering wheels. Button labels can be changed, added or deleted and will affect also other steering wheels — reducing the repetitive action of labeling all steering wheels from the scratch.

:bulb: <font color="orange">Colors and their meaning:</font>

- <font color="orange">Orange = has already been used</font>
- <font color="orange">Gray = Has not been used in anything</font>

You may encounter an issue which is highlighted in the **Input** tab as yellow color on a button. This is an indication that the label isn't configured.

- To fix this, please make sure that you have assigned a label in **Configure Button Labels** window through the "hamburger" menu in top left corner.
- Or remap the button to some other label.
