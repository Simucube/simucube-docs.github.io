!!! info "Connecting through Simucube 2 Wheelbase"
    To use this feature you will need to connect the wireless wheel via Simucube Link Hub,
    a separate device, instead through the Simucube 2. You can find the Simucube Link Hub 
    from our store page [here](https://simucube.com/link-hub/){ target="_blank" }.


## Input

### Open Input tab
1. Select Steering Wheel from the device list in overview or in left side panel
2. In top left corner under the ”hamburger" menu is a tab called "**Input**". Usually when you open the steering wheel this tab is automatically selected.

### Configure Button Labels

Button labels are useful for users who have multiple steering wheels. Button labels can be changed, added or deleted and will affect also other steering wheels — reducing the repetitive action of labeling all steering wheels from the scratch.

!!! warning "Colours of the buttons may indicate conflicts"
    You may encounter an issue with your **inputs**, and this will be shown to you in the bottom left corner of the input window with an exclamation mark and an explanation. Please follow the message suggestion to resolve the issue.
