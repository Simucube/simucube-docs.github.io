## Typical installations

The illustration below demostrates the typical configurations of ActivePedal. ActivePedal kits will come with the necessary cables.

!!! Info "Connecting passive pedals"
    Passive pedals that are not designed for ActivePedal connector will require an adapter cable. Check navigate to Accessories section for current availability. 

    For example Simucube Throttle is directy compatible (no adapter needed) and Heusinkveld pedals require an adapter cable.

!!! Warning
    To avoid damaging devices and prevent physical hazards, make changes to cabling only when DC power source has been **fully unplugged** from the mains input (house wall AC power socket). Powering off with POWER button alone is not sufficient.
