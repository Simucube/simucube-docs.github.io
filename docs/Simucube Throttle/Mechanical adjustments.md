# Mechanical adjustments

Pedal face height, angle, force curve and tilt may be mechanically adjusted with the included Torx key.

</br>
</br>

## Pedal face height

To adjust the height of pedal face:

1. Loosen, don’t remove, the two (2) screws fixing the pedal, one on each side
2. Adjust the pedal height
3. Tighten the screws to approximately 3 Nm torque

</br>
</br>

## Pedal face angle

To adjust the angle of the pedal face:

1. Loosen, don’t remove, the four (4) fixing screws, two on each side
2. Set the pedal angle
3. Tighten the screws to approximately 3 Nm torque

</br>
</br>

## Pedal tilt

1. Loosen the two (2) screws on pedal subframe
2. Move the now sliding subframe to desired position
3. Tighten screws to approximately 3 Nm torque

</br>
</br>

## Force curve

1. Loosen the screw on pedal lever
2. Move the now sliding joint to desired position
3. Tighten screw to approximately 5 Nm torque

## Spring replacement

### Important note
During spring replacement, do not let the pedal go out of bounds of nominal movement as illustrated in the image below.

Keep the pedal upright during the change:

### Changing the spring

1: Apply pressure to pedalface
<br>
2: Unscrew end stop

<br>

3: Release pressure slowly from pedalface and slide shaft assembly out

<br>

4: Remove spring

<br>

5: Remove plastic ring from spring

<br>

6: Install new spring by reversing the previous steps. Note that plastic ring should point to rear of the Throttle. Ring protects aluminium part from scratches.

Pre-installed spring is red curve on diagram. From the additional springs, blue curve is softer and green curve is harder.

## Preload & travel adjustment

Throttle has adjustments for preload & travel. Choose the positions according to your preferred feel.
