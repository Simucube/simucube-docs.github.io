# Software setup

This section goes through the basic first-time use setup of the Simucube 2 wheel base.

## 1. Install Tuner

Simucube Tuner is the current configuration software for Simucube 2 wheelbase. To get started [download Tuner](../../Tuner/index.md) and launch the installer.

## 2. Check cabling

If you haven't done connections yet, see [cabling](../Cabling.md).

## 3. Install steering wheel 
 
Fix steering wheel (not included) to Simucube Quick Release™ (SQR™). If required, install Spacer and/or 70 mm Adapter between the SQR wheel side part and the wheel. 

## 4. Power on

After the installation steps are completed it is time to turn on the Simucube 2. This is done by pressing the button on the backside the unit (Sport and Pro) or via the toggle switch on the Premium Torque Off button (Ultimate).

## 5. Software configuration

### Firmware update

Simucube 2 is shipped with factory installed firmware, that is likely quite old. Therefore, when the Simucube Tuner software is started for the first time, firmware update is needed. This is also indicated in the software. Press the indication text or bottom left corner "firmware update" -button to open a pop-up which lists all the devices that can be updated. Updating the device firmware is done by pressing the update button. Close pop-up when ready.

### First startup

When the firmware is updated, the wheelbase can be seen in device panel on the left side of the application.

## 6. Test drive

Launch your simulator and take your first test drive. The following video has some important notes to consider when taking the first drive. Read also the separate [Driving tips section](../Driving.md) on how to approach driving and setting up the wheelbase for different simulators.
