# Driving

Driving racing simulators with high torque generating devices can be daunting if some important aspects are not considered each time. This short section is a introduction to the features of the Simucube system. It also contains useful tips and tricks to encourage safe use of the wheelbase.

## Taking the first test drive

The first test drive
can be done with any simulator, but we recommend Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione,
iRacing, or Project Cars.

1. Place the Safe Torque Off button (E-stop) in a solid place where remains quickly reachable
to the user and where it cannot drop on the floor.
2. Power on the system and verify wheel rotation with the Tuner software. You can already
create a profile and adjust some of the settings if you so wish.
3. Start the simulator. Configure the wheel to be used by assigning controls. This step differs
from simulator to simulator.
4. Take a test drive and verify wheel operation.
5. Also verify the rigidity of the Simucube 2 installation and the wheel installation.
6. On successful test drive, the user can enable the High Torque Mode by using the Tuner software. Wheel will become much more powerful and reactive, and large amount of default damping and friction on the motor shaft is removed. Wheel will feel lighter but in reality, the torque capabilities are fully utilized only in the High Torque Mode.
7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with High Torque Mode enabled.

!!! Warning
    At any point, if the rigidity of the installation is insufficient, press the Safe Torque Off button and stop driving immediately. Solve the issue before attempting further testing.
    
    Simucube 2 motor becoming loose or the simulator rig suffering mechanical failure is potentially hazardous to the user, other people near the simulator, and materials.
## Subsequent test drives

Some audible beeps may already be heard from the wheel base on the first drive. These are the potential causes for these audible notifications:

1. Torque saturation / clipping is detected. The game is giving maximum torque and no additional signal details can be felt. Tune game FFB level to lower value to solve this. You can turn this feature on/off on the configuration view for the wheelbase in Tuner.
2. On rally- and drifting type games or other aggressive driving, Simucube 2 might beep many times. This is due to automatic hands-off safety mode kicking in momentarily, which resultsin these beeps. The normal operating mode is automatically resumed when the driver is detected to be using the wheel again (additional beeps are played by the device). You can tune this feature on the configuration view for the wheelbase in Tuner and it can be turned off.

### Updates to simulators and games
The game developers can update their games at any time via automatic software deployment platforms such as Steam. They can also change their Force Feedback implementation and game controller detection codes. 

!!! tip
    Always perform a test drive after simulator/game update with the system in Safe Torque Mode (High Torque Mode not activated) to avoid unexpected behavior, such as full torque left/right.
