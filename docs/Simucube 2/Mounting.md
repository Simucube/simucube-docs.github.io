## Simucube 2 mounting

Simucube 2 wheelbase must always be mounted rigidly on to the simulator rig for user safety.

Sport and Pro models have threaded mounting holes in the front flange, so locking nuts are not required.

### Front mounting with a separate Mount
Simucube 2 supports front mounting to popular sim racing rigs by using a mounting brackets such as the Simucube Mount product.
