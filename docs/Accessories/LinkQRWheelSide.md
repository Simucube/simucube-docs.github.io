## Installation

Link Quick Release can be directly mounted on nearly any existing simulator steering wheel with a standard **70mm hole pattern** of either threaded or non-threaded holes. This allows the wheel to be quickly attached and detached from the wheelbase.

For wheels with a smaller **50.8mm hole pattern,** a spacer-adapter is required. This part also functions with
threaded and non-threaded wheels. See more information at [50.8mm adapter](../Accessories/50.8Adapter.md).

The wireless data & power transfer features of Link Quick Release are supported on some Simucube Link compatible wheels. Whether or not these electronic features are supported by your steering wheel, Link Quick Release can still nevertheless be used for purely mechanical attachment purposes.

Follow the steps below to attach your Link Quick Release to a steering wheel.

### Connecting wheel electronics (compatible wheels only)

For compatible wheels, before mounting the quick release, locate the quick release connector inside the wheel.
Connect the cable of the Link Quick Release to the connector located on the circuit board of the wheel . 
**Do not pull on the cable with force while doing this.**
