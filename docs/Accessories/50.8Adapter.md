# 50.8mm / 70mm Adapter

Some formula style steering wheels may utilize a 50.8mm mounting pattern to allow the quick release to clear shift levers and other parts. 
Simucube 50.8 to 70mm Adapter can be used to mount Link Quick Release or other quick release parts with a 70mm mounting pattern to these type of wheels.
