## Simucube button
**Note: The Simucube button is currently only supported in True Drive.**

The Simucube button is used to change force feedback parameters straight from the wheel. Here is how to use it:
1. Hold down the Simucube Button C over one second to enter Simucube Button mode
2. Use the 7-way switch D to select a parameter to modify
3. Turn the 7-way switch D to increase or decrease the selected parameter

**Directions of the 7-way switch:**

**Up:** Overall strength (selected by default when entering Simucube button mode)

**Left:** Damping

**Right:** Simucube Force Reconstruction filter

**Down:** Nothing yet, reserved for future use

Pressing a parameter selection for more than 2 seconds will reset the parameter to the previous value in True Drive.
