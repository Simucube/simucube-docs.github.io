## Software & User guide
The Simucube Savu wheels are supported by the Simucube Tuner. Download the latest version of the Simucube software from [here](https://www.simucube.com/downloads).
The user guide for the Simucube software can be found [here](../../Tuner/index.md).

## Power & connection

![](assets%2Fbuttons_and_indicators.svg)

### Power
The wheel has a power button (1) on the backside. When pressed down, the wheel is powered on. 

### Connection
The RGB lights on the wheel remain off until the wheel is connected. To connect the wheel, first press the power button (1) to turn the wheel on. When the wheel is attempting to connect, the power LED (3) will blink orange slowly. After pressing the power button (1), the wheel will attempt to connect for 10 seconds. If the connection is not made within this time, the wheel will enter sleep mode. To re-enter connection mode, press both paddles (3) simultaneously. The power LED will blink orange slowly for another 10 seconds as the wheel is trying to connect. Once a connection is successfully established, the power LED (3) will blink quickly three times, then turn off, and the RGB lights on the wheel will turn on. 

Further instructions for connecting the wheel to the Tuner software can be found [here](../../Tuner/steeringwheel/index.md).

### Charging
**Note:** Do not use the wheel while charging to avoid damaging the cable or the connector.

**Note:** SC3 versions do not have built-in battery. They are powered when attached to the wheelbase, with both the wheel and wheelbase turned on.

To charge the wheel, connect the USB Type-C charging cable to the wheel and to a USB power source. The LED indicator will turn green when charging and switch off when fully charged.

Charge time from empty to full is approximately 4 hours.

See above for fault codes. If the LED indicator is red, the wheel is not charging. Check the cable and the connector for damage and try again.

## Adjustments

To install the extra paddles, use the provided Torx T-20 T-wrench to remove the covers on the back of the wheel (1). Using the same screws, install the extra paddles in place (2). When tightening the screws, push the paddles towards the center of the wheel. If the actuation of the paddle happens to deep into the throw, the actuation point can be further adjusted by using the provided shimming stickers (3).
