# Simucube Co-Pedal

The Simucube Co-Pedal offers a whole new approach to passive pedals and their adjustments. Co-Pedal is assembled as a Throttle out-of-box, but can be converted to a clutch in just few minutes.

- Already have an ActivePedal? Get the Co-Pedal for throttle use. 
- Want have a force feedback throttle? Just switch your Co-Pedal to a clutch setup with no compromises.
