## Before you buy

??? question "Which rigs are compatible with Co-Pedal?"

    Rig compatibility depends just on mechanical fitting and mounting, which means that nearly all rigs are compatible at least with some installation effort. To get an idea, see  [Mounting](Mounting.md).

??? question "Does Simucube Co-Pedal work with other pedal sets"

    Simucube Co-Pedal is intended to be used with ActivePedal but does work atleast with Heusinkveld brake pedals. However, you need the Simucube ActivePedal Connector, which you would normally use to connect Heusinkveld pedals to ActivePedal.

??? question "Can Simucube Co-Pedal be used as stand-alone input device"

    No. Simucube Co-Pedal does not come with USB hub and has to be connected to ActivePedal in order to operate.

??? question "Does Simucube Co-Pedal require also the Simucube BasePlate item?"

    No. Simucube BasePlate is designed to make installation easier, enhance ergonomics wiht foot rest, and add adjustability. For list of required items, see [Items needed](Items needed.md).

??? question "Are ActivePedal and Co-Pedal pedal faces interchangeable?"

    Yes. The Co-Pedal and ActivePedal share identical dimensions for their pedal face attachments, allowing for interchangeability of pedal faces between the two.

??? question "Do i really have to use the correct spring with its designated profile?"

    No and this is the fun part. You can for example, create a short travel regressive throttle by combining the clutch profile with throttle spring.

??? question "Where is the load cell?"

    There is none, throttle & clutch are position based inputs.
