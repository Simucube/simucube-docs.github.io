!!! Info
    All of four (4) screws must be used in clamping. Tighten screws to sufficient torque (~2 Nm).

## Mounting with Simucube Baseplate

Simucube Baseplate is a optional accessory that provides easy mounting, adjustability and comfort when using certain pedals. Mounting with Baseplate is identical to profile mounting which is shown below.

For more info and assembly instructions, see [Simucube Baseplate](../ActivePedal/Baseplate.md).

## Mounting directly to the rig

Co-Pedal may be mounted also without Baseplate directly to the rig. Installation method depends on the rig model and construction. Most common methods are illustrated below.
